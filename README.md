# LimitFace
Watch face for round ConnectIQ watches that shows a countdown to a step limit per day.

Useful if you're injured and supposed to be limiting how much you're walking per day, uses your step goal as an upper limit instead of a goal and shows a countdown/bar of how many km you have left in your "allowance" that day.
